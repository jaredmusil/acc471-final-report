# Future Analysis

As with any data analysis, the quality of the input data will determine the quality of the resulting models. In this case we started with 26 factors. A good way to increase the quality of the model would be to provide it with more factors and potentially more levels within the factors.

All of this data also is only related to the automobeile itself, and does not account for the individual driving it. While some behavorial and demographic factors protected by federal law from being used for analysis like race and religion(CITE), Others such as gender are allowed. Including these behavorial factors as inputs into the model would be an opportunity to strethen the existing model. Technology and in partucular the increase of telematics within vehicles and internet of things (IoT) connected devices, will increase the ubiquity and variety of this datastream. With the advances in autonomous vehicles, behavorial factors may impact results less, but is something to monitor for the future of auto risk classification.
